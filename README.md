From [the "Data is Plural" newsletter](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2021-11-10-edition/): 
     > ProPublica published what itâ€™s calling "[the most detailed map of cancer-causing industrial air pollution in the U.S.](https://projects.propublica.org/toxmap/)," along with an [investigation](https://www.propublica.org/article/toxmap-poison-in-the-air) based on the map's revelations. In a [methodology article](https://www.propublica.org/article/how-we-created-the-most-detailed-map-ever-of-cancer-causing-industrial-air-pollution), reporters explain how they analyzed billions of rows of data from the Environmental Protection Agency's [Risk-Screening Environmental Indicators model](https://www.epa.gov/rsei), which "takes a variety of inputs, including emissions data, weather modeling, and facility specific information, and puts out estimated concentrations of toxic chemicals in the air around industrial facilities." The EPA [publishes the model's output](https://www.epa.gov/rsei/ways-get-rsei-results) as bulk downloads, in an online dashboard, and in other formats.

- [datamade/census](https://github.com/datamade/census) - A Python wrapper for the U.S. Census API.
- [datadesk/census-error-analyzer](https://github.com/datadesk/census-error-analyzer) - Given two Census values and the corresponding margins of error, this Python library can do an analysis to determine whether there is a statistically significant difference between them.

### Code for geospatial manipulation
- [mggg/maup](https://github.com/mggg/maup) - "The geospatial toolkit for redistricting data", a Python package designed to facilitate conversion between spatial regions used for elections (e.g., precincts) and spatial regions used by the Census to collect demographic information (e.g., blocks).

### Code/service for calculating routes between locations
- [Jupyter notebook examples](https://github.com/GIScience/openrouteservice-examples/) of how to use [the API](https://openrouteservice.org/) of the [OpenRouteService routing calculator](https://maps.openrouteservice.org/), which currently has a generous free tier, providing not just routing/directions, but maps, geocoding, isochrones, and elevation information.

## Other relevant data
- See our [Other Useful Datasets GitHub repo](https://github.com/WPRDC/other-useful-datasets/tree/main) for links to non-WPRDC datasets that could be helpful when working with WPRDC datasets.
